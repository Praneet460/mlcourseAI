### Questions

#### 1. How old were the youngest male and female participants of the 1996 Olympics?

```{r}
year_1996 <- filter(data, Year == 1996)
year_1996_male <- filter(year_1996, Sex == "M")
year_1996_female <- filter(year_1996, Sex == "F")
year_1996_male_young <- min(year_1996_male$Age, na.rm = T)
year_1996_female_young <- min(year_1996_female$Age, na.rm = T)
print(year_1996_male_young)
print(year_1996_female_young)
```

*Result :* Youngest 1996 male pparticipant is 14 years old and youngest 1996 female participant is 12 years old.


#### 2. What was the percentage of male gymnasts among all the male participants of the 2000 Olympics? Round the answer to the first decimal.

```{r}
year_2000 =  filter(data, Year == 2000)
year_2000_male = filter(year_2000, Sex == "M")
year_2000_male_unique <- year_2000_male[!duplicated(year_2000_male$Name),]
male_unique <- nrow(year_2000_male_unique)
print(male_unique)
```

```{r}

male_gymnastics <- filter(year_2000_male_unique, Sport == "Gymnastics")
gymnastics_unique <- nrow(male_gymnastics)
print(gymnastics_unique)
```



```{r}
print(round(gymnastics_unique/male_unique * 100, digit=1))
```

*Result :* The percentage change is 1.5

#### 3. What are the mean and standard deviation of height for female basketball players participated in the 2000 Olympics? Round the answer to the first decimal.

```{r}
year_2000_female_basketball <- filter(data, Year == 2000, Sex == "F", Sport == "Basketball")
print(round(mean(year_2000_female_basketball$Height), digits = 1))
print(round(sd(year_2000_female_basketball$Height), digits = 1))
```

*Result :* The mean is 182.4 and standard deviation is 9.1


#### 4. Find a sportsperson participated in the 2002 Olympics, with the highest weight among other participants of the same Olympics. What sport did he or she do?

```{r}
year_2002 <- filter(data, Year == 2002)
year_2002_highest_weight <- max(year_2002$Weight, na.rm = T)
sportsmen <- filter(year_2002, Weight == year_2002_highest_weight)
print(sportsmen$Sport)
```

*Result :* Sports is Bobsleigh

#### 5. How many times did Pawe Abratkiewicz participate in the Olympics held in different years?

```{r}
pawe <- filter(data, Name == "Pawe Abratkiewicz")
pawe %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(n())
```

*Result :* Participated in 3 different years i.e. 1992, 1998, and 2002. Each year 2 times.


#### 6. How many silver medals in tennis did Australia win at the 2000 Olympics?

```{r}
year_2000_tennis_aust_silver <- filter(data, Year == 2000, Sport == "Tennis", Team == "Australia", Medal == "Silver")
print(nrow(year_2000_tennis_aust_silver))
```

*Result :* Win 2 silver medals


#### 7. Is it true that Switzerland won fewer medals than Serbia at the 2016 Olympics? Do not consider NaN values in Medal column.

```{r}
year_2016_swit <- filter(data, Year == 2016, Team == "Switzerland")
year_2016_swit %>%
  group_by(Medal) %>%
  summarise(n()) 
```

Total medals won by Switzerland are 11.

```{r}
year_2016_serb <- filter(data, Year == 2016, Team == "Serbia")
year_2016_serb %>%
  group_by(Medal) %>%
  summarise(n())
```

Total medals won by Serbia are 54.

*Result :* Yes Switzerland won fewer medals than Serbia.


#### 8. What age category did the fewest and the most participants of the 2014 Olympics belong to?

```{r}
year_2014 <- filter(data, Year == 2014)
year_2014 %>%

```

*Result :* Fewest [45-55] and most [25-35]

#### 9. Is it true that there were Summer Olympics held in Lake Placid? Is it true that there were Winter Olympics held in Sankt Moritz?

year_2016 <- filter(data, Year == 2016)
year_2016_sport <- year_2016 %>%
  group_by(Sport) %>%
  summarise(n_distinct(Sport))
print(nrow(year_2016_sport))
```

*Result :* There is no sports played in 1995. So the difference is equal to the sports played in 2016 i.e. 34
